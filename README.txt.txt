Thank you for downloading A.R.O.
Made by: Ilan Gonzalez Carigi
This project is open source and can be used in any project as long as the proper credits are mentioned

A.R.O. is a set of 2 scripts to help developers in integrating gravitacional physicics in their games 
without the need to use heavy formulas for simululations and also enabling customization in the formula
for more game-oriented possibilities and results

The code is written in c++ for the UE4, but can be easily changed to other languages
due to it's null dependency to the engine.

Warning:
The code will give not act as expected in the case of:
A) Max Distance is set to an incredibe high number (will be heavy on the machine).
B) If the AROTarget positions is the same as the ARO in any given time.
